Welcome to part-3 of the Python Crash Course series. This is the last section in this course, and we are super glad that you have made it this far! 

In this last notebook you will be taught the concepts of functional and object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. These are two of the most important concepts in any programming language, so make sure that you understand these concepts properly. 

Once you are done with this tutorial, you will be ready to start your Machine Learning journey. We will be waiting for you at the starting line in the Machine Learing Easy Track. See you there!
