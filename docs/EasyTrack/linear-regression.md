There are mainly three types of algorithms in Machine Learning, namely: Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning. Since, Linear Regression is a Supervised Machine Learning algorithm , we'll focus on that for this topic. <br/>

Supervised Machine Learning means that the algorithm is first trained on a labelled dataset (generally referred to as training data) to form a model. After this, the machine is provided with a new set of data (known as the test data), and the model uses the acquired knowledge to predict the outcomes for this test data. For instance, when we were kids, our parents taught us what a cow, rabbit, snake, squirrel, etc. are. In other words, they trained us. After that, whenever we see an animal now (test data), we are able to classify it depending on our knowledge. This is Supervised Learning. <br/>

Supervised ML algorithms are of 2 types: <br/>
1. Classification: In this, the output variable is a category (discrete, categorical target variable) <br/>
2. Regression: In this, the output variable is a value (continuous target variable) <br/>

Let's talk about regression now. <br/>

The term "regression" means "coming back to the average". <br/> 

Regression Analysis is a mathematical measure to determine the average relationship between two or more variables in terms of original units of data. In regression analysis, we have two types of variables: Dependent variable (target/output variable) and independent variable (predictor/input
