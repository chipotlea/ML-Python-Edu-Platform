Welcome to the starting point. This is your first step into the Data Science and Machine learning world and we are very pleased to have you on our platform. Please go through all of the algorithms very well, make some notes, have a look at how these models are made, play around with data set and don't forget to have fun while you do that! You will be first walked through all of the theory and the important terminology which will be followed by a Notebook that will teach you how to implement the algorithm that you learnt. You will also have a code editor to write some code and run it. Inorder to finish every section, you need to pass a final quiz! That's it! All the best for your journey and we hope you return here one day as a contributor.<br/>
